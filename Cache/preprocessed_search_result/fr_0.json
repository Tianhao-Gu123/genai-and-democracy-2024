        "Donald Trump, in Altanta, Georgia, June 27, 2024. MARCO BELLO / REUTERS Donald Trump is living a period of felicity. A few days after Joe Biden’s shipwreck, during their televised debate, the former president received, Monday, July 1, another joyful news. Unsurprisingly, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court dealt a severe blow to the federal investigation into the attempted coup that led to the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol. Asked to rule on the total presidential immunity demanded by Donald Trump as part of his past duties, the court did not consent to this request, extravagant in the eyes of lawyers. But, behind the subtleties of the decision, the victory is no less spectacular for the Republican candidate, who sees the threat of a trial in this case move away. Donald Trump can also hope for favorable responses in other investigations against him, especially the one conducted in Georgia about the pressure exerted, at the end of 2020, on the officials of this state to modify the result of the election. The court’s president, John Roberts, author of the decision approved by six judges against three, points out that “the nature of presidential power requires that a former president be granted some form of immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts committed during his mandate.” Immunity that must be absolute, he adds, with regard to the core of his constitutional prerogatives. For his other official acts, in areas where he shares authority with Congress, he must also benefit from a form of “presumption of immunity”, which can only be lifted on a case-by-case basis, in court, depending on the relevance of the evidence gathered by the prosecution.

Three possible scenarios are therefore sketched out, but without a clearly defined perimeter for the last two. This is Tanya Chutkan, the judge presiding over the January 6, 2021 fact-finding hearing in Washington, D.C., invested with immense responsibility. But time is running out. Behind this apparent prudence of the Court and its apology for the separation of powers, the majority of judges build a series of walls, of various sizes, around the presidential institution, and therefore Donald Trump. John Roberts seems especially concerned about possible political prosecutions against a president, in defiance of the heart of the file: an attempted coup. He is concerned about the intrusion of the judiciary into the executive, the deterrent and disruptive effect that would be the threat of criminal prosecution of a president, in key arbitrations.
