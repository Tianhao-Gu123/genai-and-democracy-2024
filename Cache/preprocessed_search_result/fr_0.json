        "Fires in California don’t spare anyone, not even Michael Jackson. His famous estate, the Neverland Ranch, has almost been ravaged by “Lake Fire”, a fire that has been burning since last weekend in Santa Barbara County, already destroying more than 10,500 hectares. Since Sunday, the ranch has been threatened by southwest winds fanning flames. Firefighters in Santa Barbara reported temperatures as high as 35°C with particularly dry air. The causes of the fire, which are still unknown, are being investigated by the police. lakefire onassignment AFPphoto pic.twitter.com/FELVkEM7qs David Swanson (SwansonPhotog) July 10, 2024 Access"
